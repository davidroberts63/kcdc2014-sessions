    author: 'James Bender',
    description: 'Users of web applications are demanding more. More interaction, more usability and a better overall user experience. A great way to do that is with AJAX and REST services. These technologies allow developers to create interactions in web applications that rival desktop applications. But many developers don\'t have all the pieces of the puzzle, or don\'t understand how to put them together. This session will introduce you to REST based services and demonstrate how to create these services in C# with ASP.NET Web API. You\'ll learn how POX and JSON are different than SOAP, and which to use when. Finally, you\'ll see how to tie this altogether in your web application using the JQuery JavaScript libraries and letting it do the heavy lifting for you. You will learn: How to build enhanced interactivity into their ASP.NET web applications How services play a crucial role in delivering this enhanced user experience To create REST based services on two different platforms (WCF and ASP.NET Web API) The JQuery library and how it can jump start their client side ASP.NET development',

The best way to learn Agile principles is to jump into the deep end and to start practicing it. However, a common issue teams run into is where there is too much focus on the Agile Ceremonies and not enough on whether the team\'s practices support Agile principles. Practices such as too many capabilities in progress, not meeting iteration commitments, long release cycle, number of defects, technical debt and lack of planning are some of the red flags that teams can look at to gauge themselves. In this talk, we will go over how to identify these red flags and also go over ideas of how to fix them for your teams.

Domain Driven Design is gaining popularity since Eric Evans published his Blue Book. Using these two techniques of software design offers a powerful combination when approaching a complex domain. CQRS strives to partition your system in to a \'write side\' and a \'read side\'. When you throw Event Sourcing in to the mix, this fits nicely with the domain model of DDD and can actually help to simplify the code within your domain and reduce accidental complexity (think ORM). In this session I will demonstrate some of the core concepts of CQRS with event sourcing and DDD. I will explain how to write your commands, how commands are handled by the domain model, how events are defined and how they are raised by the domain, how events are consumed to update the read model.',

In this session, Matt Ingenthron and Brett Lawson will first talk about what is different about this generation of web applications. The approach must consider the latency, throughput and interactivity demanded by users for social interaction across both mobile devices and browsers. Then they will show how Node.js\'s programming model makes writing systems to provide this kind of interactivity easy and how Couchbase Server and the Node.js Couchbase SDK support this with a flexible data model and easy scalability. Come to this session ready to read code, since a sample game platform will be the basis of a demonstration of these techniques in action. Brett and Matt will show a sample game server, and key aspects of how the system is constructed for simplicity of data modeling, extensibility and scale.',

In this talk I will introduce an agile approach to business intelligence that drives decision support, feeds data analysis, and delivers flexible reporting capabilities, all built using Ruby, Rails, and MongoDB. We will explore the complete architecture of a lightweight BI system that is used in the real world to capture and analyze customer information, monitor user behaviour, feed machine-learning algorithms for decision support, and deliver real knowledge and value to business stakeholders.',

    author: 'James Bender',
    description: 'A key concept of any Agile methodology is communication. It\'s no longer normal or acceptable for developers to sit and develop applications in isolation from the business. To that end, developers and business domain experts have been trying to find better ways to communicate. While developers tend to speak in terms of \'code and technology\' most business domain experts are more comfortable communicating in terms of scenarios, workflows and business rules. Test Driven Development (TDD) was the first step in getting these two groups to communicate in the same way. Developers could write unit tests that expressed business requirements with the hope that business users could validate that what was being tested was in fact what the desired behavior was. But, unit tests are still code and while it was better, the communication was still stilted and inefficient. To help this communication new techniques such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) have become popular. Along with these new ideas, new tools like SpecFlow have become popular as a means to express unit tests in a way that the business can better understand and validate. This session will demonstrate how SpecFlow can be leveraged in your BDD or ATDD practices. The Gherkin language and the \'Given, When, Then\' paradigm will be explained and you will see how to write tests in a way that business users are not only capable of reading, but can also help you create them.

But what does "open source" truly mean? Especially when working in a professional or corporate environment, what are our rights and limitations as open source consumers to use, modify, and redistribute these tools? Often that depends upon the authors\' own decisions regarding project licensing. In this one-hour session, we will review a few of the core principals of open-source development and consumption, comparing and contrasting some of the more popular licenses in use today.

You want asynchronous, isolated I/O? You want on-the-fly decisions? We have it all! This talk introduces reactive data processing in Scala. See code that modifies its flow at runtime. Scalaz streams (emphasis on the zed) showcases Scala\'s confluence of OO+FP with a productively lazy, reassuringly safe, purely functional style. And modularity!

    description: 'Most developers now understand the value of testing for verifying the functionality within a project, regardless of the programming language. Developers and team leads often ask the following types of questions, when trying to create or work with automated tests. How do you know when you have enough testing? How can you remain productive, if the tests you\'ve written run for a long time? How does your QA team know what areas are lacking in tests and should be focused upon for manual testing? I\'ve got passing tests, but how do I know if other problems exist in the code? Is there a tool to help in determining if problems exist in the code design? This session will present two tools to help with overcoming some of the difficulties of testing and analyzing your program and design for problems. First, it will cover how you can use Maven to help in breaking up fast unit tests from slow integration tests in your Java project, so that you can run your fast tests more frequently. Second, it will look at Sonar, a continuous quality / static analysis tool, which has plug-in support for most major programming languages. Using Sonar, the presentation will go over ways to check your code for problems, bad practices, and design failures, which might have otherwise been missed, in addition to checking to see just where and how well your tests are testing the code.',

Agile principles state that "Working software is the primary measure of progress" and "Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the work not done -- is essential". In an effort to achieve these principles, it is easy to get into a state where the first release, becomes the final architecture and creates endless amount of technical debt and hacks, which eventually make the system brittle and complex. In this talk, we will go over some of the patterns that need to be built into the system; code, team and culture, that would enable you to deliver early, deliver often and all along constantly learning from your implementation and refining or even redesigning your complete architecture to incrementally build the product, with higher quality, higher business value and minimal technical debt.

    description: 'When designing and architecting a software solution, there are many decisions to be made; not least of which is how your services, sub systems and components will be organized, structured and coupled together. Most architects and software engineers succumb to the fallacy of functional based decomposition, where the system is architected based on the requirements and features being requested. Functional architecture is so commonplace, and so convenient, that most software firms don\'t even realize they are doing it. However, this leads to rigid, tightly coupled, and expensive systems with little ability to adapt to changing requirements, environments and constraints. Taken from Juval Lowy\'s teachings from the IDesign Architect Master Class, this presentation will cover, at a high level, a new, more effective way of architecting systems that are truly extensible, adaptable and scalable. The session will cover the overall concept of volatility based decomposition, the axis of volatility, encapsulating volatility, contract factoring and how to test your design for functional shortcomings.
